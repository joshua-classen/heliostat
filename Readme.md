Sun Follower | heliostat

This repo contains code for my heliostat robot which is able to align itself to a light source.

The heliostat in action can be viewed on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elJdgMtm6Kk
I developed and built the heliostat in year 2015

Years ago I uploaded the files to bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ckrex/myheliostatcontrol/src/master/

I am looking for the EAGLE files an add them to the repo
